          <h2 id="About-me"><a href="#About-me" class="headerlink" title="About me"></a>About me</h2><p>I am currently a PhD student in the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.hawaii.edu/sls/">Department of Second Language Studies</a> at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa. You can check out my <a href="/cv/rickey-larkin-cv.pdf">CV</a> for detials of my work in Applied Sociolinguistics. My PhD focus has been on linguistic landscape research, as well as some interactional sociolinguistics projects (the results of these have yet to be published). During my MA, I mostly worked on an English second language writing <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jeap.2021.100967">corpus project</a>. In the past, I worked with Peace Corps Philippines on language related projects, as well as with the U.S. State Department on virtual English lessons in Mexico. I credit my undergraduate experience with the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://miamioh.edu/myaamia-center/">Myaamia Center</a> for inspiring my professional path in language education and for my academic interests in the social influences on language. I do other things too, like rock climbing and writing bad poetry. My grandparents on both sides were part of the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillbilly_Highway">Hillbilly Highway</a>.</p>
<h2 id="About-this-website"><a href="#About-this-website" class="headerlink" title="About this website"></a>About this website</h2><p>This website was built using <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://hexo.io/">hexo</a>! Hexo makes it easy to build static sites such as this in markdown. Please see the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://hexo.io/docs/">documentation</a> for more info. The theme used is <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/probberechts/hexo-theme-cactus">cactus</a>. Colors are inspired by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://protesilaos.com/">Protesilaos Stavrou’s modus theme</a>. Previously I hosted this page using the University of Hawaiʻi’s <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.hawaii.edu/askus/694">free SFTP hosting</a>, however I couldn’t get hexo to automatically deploy using it. I’m not sure if this was an error on my part or a limitation of UH’s hosting service, or a problem with hexo. At any rate, I am now hosting it on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://pages.github.com/">github pages</a>. I plan on rewritting the website eventually and moving it to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a>.</p>
<p>Hexo and github pages requires a minimal level of technical skill. If you’re just looking for an easy way to have an online portfolio, there are many options such as <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.wix.com/">wix</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://wordpress.org/hosting/">wordpress</a>, and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://sites.google.com/">google sites</a>. I’ve used each of these in the past and they are simple to use.</p>
<h2 id="About-my-CV"><a href="#About-my-CV" class="headerlink" title="About my CV"></a>About my CV</h2><p>My CV was created in LaTeX using <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.overleaf.com/">overleaf</a> with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.latextemplates.com/template/compact-academic-cv">this template</a>. The template was originally made by Dario Taraborelli and then recompiled by Vel for use in overleaf. I’m attempting to transition away from overleaf and write everything in markdown using pandoc to convert to LaTeX. However, this is a bit of an uphill battle. I think once I get the hang of things this will help my productivitiy–but we’ll see if that’s true.</p>
<h2 id="About-my-teaching"><a href="#About-my-teaching" class="headerlink" title="About my teaching"></a>About my teaching</h2><p>Here is a list of university courses I have taught by semester. You can also check out my <a href="/2020/08/25/teaching-philosophy/" title="teaching philosophy">teaching philosophy</a>, which is a bit outdated and needs rewriting. I think a good teaching philosophy means that it is updated every so often as you grow as a teacher. They are strange documents. I have also taught English to children and adults in various settings in-person and online in the Philippines, Taiwan, Vietnam, Brazil, Mexico, South Korea, and the United States.</p>
